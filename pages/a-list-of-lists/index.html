        founded in 2004 in Norway by Leona Johansson and Tommy Hol Ellingsen. It
        funds itself through a website of sexually explicit videos and

        limited number of earthworm species are capable of anterior

        the worm (where the mouth is located) can feed and survive&quot;

        &quot;The Body in the cylinder refers to a male decedent discovered
        within a partially sealed steel cylinder on a derelict WWII bomb site in
        Liverpool, England. The discovery was made on 13 July 1945 and it is
        believed that the body had lain undiscovered for 60 years. Inquiries
        named a strong (but unconfirmed) candidate for the identity of the
        decedent; however, the cause of death and the reason for their presence
        in the cylinder remain a mystery.&quot;
